 Minimum Profit: the mptxt format 

 Angel Ortega <angel@triptico.com> 

The mptxt format is a very lightweight text formatting that can be
converted by the Minimum Profit text editor to other text formats. This
document describes version 1.00 of the mptxt format.

Output formats supported as of Minimum Profit 5.32 is RTF and troff.

Default paragraphs are delimited by blank lines; line breaks can be used
arbitrarily and treated the same as spaces. On output they follow the
de-facto spanish literary convention: first line is indented unless it's
the first paragraph of the text or if it follows a special section, like a
centered text or a section break.

Paragraphs with a leading space are treated as _verbatim_ text; in this
kind of text, line breaks are meaningful and no justification is done.
This is an example:

 From: Angel Ortega <angel@triptico.com>
 To: <undisclosed>
 Subject: Release captain Trips
 
 This is an example email.

This kind of paragraphs shall be shown in a monospaced font if the output
format makes it possible.

If a paragraph is made of lines with a leading space *and* a trailing
space, it's treated as text that must be shown centered, as in titles,
subtitles. This is an example:

 INTERREGNO EVIL CORPORATION 
 NO ENTRY 
 TRESPASSERS SHALL BE SHOT ON SIGHT 

Or, for example, to introduce a section separator, like this:

 *** 

If the output format support it somehow, URLs shall be made clickable,
like when writing one like http://triptico.com or similar.

Text that must be shown emphasized can be surrounded by underscores, like
in _this example_. As well, strong text can be surrounded by asterisks,
like in the *this very attention-demanding text*.

Unicode is accepted wherever possible; some output formats have encoding
limitations, though, so be creative.

Some output formatting can be tweaked via configuration variables, see
mp.config for details.

Finally, please note that this format has been designed to make it suitable
for writing by Angel Ortega. You may find it useless, stupid or whatever.
I don't care. Keep moving.
